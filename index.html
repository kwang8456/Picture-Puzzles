<!-- This project was decent. Something that went well was setting up the table because it is very 
    similar to the slider puzzle. However, something that didn't go as intended was trying to code 
    the functions that would check if the images are in the correct places because a single space 
    could affect your whole entire code. It was mostly practicing already known skills because I 
    have used the tables, buttons, and innerHTML for my project. One thing that sticked to me the 
    most is the document.getElementById ("").innerHTML because I have been using it repeatedly 
    throughout my whole entire project and I don't have to set it to an object in order to edit the 
    innerHTML. -->
